Repository for tools used for data capture

cameras - contains scripts and apps (mostly gstreamer-based) for capturing
from various cameras (v4l2 cameras primarily) from a Jetson board (TX2).

imu - contains code for capturing from some IMUs that I've used in the past.  

combination - apps that capture from more than one sensor source at a time
